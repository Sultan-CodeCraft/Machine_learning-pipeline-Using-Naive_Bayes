## Machine_learning-pipeline-Using-Naive_Bayes
- The workflow for text classification using NaIve Bayes classifiers with different feature extraction techniques(count vectorizer,TF/IDF).
- 3 dataset files (train, test, validation) training for model training, validation for model testing and test dataset file is used to generate model predictions.
- It includes **data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, validation, and prediction, and it saves the predictions to CSV files for further analysis**.
